class_name LowPolyTerrainMeshBuilder

## Stateless geometry factory shared by every terrain backend. Gathers geofenced points,
## performs dynamic edge decimation, injects slope-aware vertex jittering, and triangulates
## organic low-poly meshes via Delaunay.
##
## This class holds no instance state whatsoever. Both the MeshInstance3D based chunk nodes
## and the RenderingServer based backend call the very same static functions, which guarantees
## that the produced geometry is bit-identical across backends.


## True when two grid points carry identical paint. Compared byte for byte on purpose: the
## weights are quantised precisely so that neighbours inside one painted area come out equal
## and can still be decimated away.

## The surface normal at one grid point, taken from the HEIGHT FIELD rather than from the
## triangles around it.
##
## This exists because smooth shading is otherwise seam-ridden at chunk borders.
## SurfaceTool.generate_normals() averages the faces it can see, and it can only see the ones in
## the chunk being built - so a border vertex is averaged over its own half of the surface while
## the neighbouring chunk averages the other half, and the two arrive at different normals for
## the same point in space. That difference is a lit seam along every chunk boundary.
##
## Reading the height field instead removes the cause rather than the symptom: it is one
## continuous surface that knows nothing about chunks, so both sides of a border compute the
## same answer from the same numbers. The padded window is what makes the neighbours' heights
## available a cell beyond the edge.
##
## Computed as the sum of the cross products around the point's four neighbours, which is the
## average of the normals of the faces meeting there - the same quantity generate_normals()
## produces, only read off the height field instead of off one chunk's triangles. That is the
## point: it agrees with what smooth shading conventionally means AND with the neighbouring
## chunk, where generate_normals() can only manage the first.
##
## Central differences would also work and be cheaper. This form is preferred because it weights
## each quadrant by its own steepness, so an asymmetric neighbourhood - a point on the shoulder
## of a ridge, say - leans towards the steep side the way the surrounding triangles do, instead
## of reporting the average of the two opposite slopes. On a symmetric neighbourhood the two
## agree exactly, and both correctly report a symmetric peak as vertical: its four faces cancel,
## which is what an averaged vertex normal is.
##
## `x` and `z` are chunk-local grid coordinates; the padding offset is applied here.
